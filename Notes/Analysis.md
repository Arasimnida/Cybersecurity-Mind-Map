In this step we analyse every [[Digital evidence]] that we found during the previous step.

## The goal
Locate and **extract all material evidence**, both:
- *Inculpatory*: evidence that **supports** a given theory
- *Exculpatory*: evidence that **contradicts** a given theory

Use court **recognised [[Forensics tools]]** and document everything.

Examine existing artifices **looking for evidence**.
- What kinds of evidence?

**Overt evidence**: Look through your data image for overt evidence. For example, pictures, documents, spreadsheets, etc. that could be  evidence.

**Hidden evidence**: Look for evidence that the system may have hidden.

**Deleted evidence**: Look for evidence that the user may have deleted, but is still recoverable, see [[Recover deleted files]].

**Anti-forensic trails**: Look for evidence of [[Anti-forensic techniques]] being employed.

## Forms of event reconstitution
There is 3 different possible reconstitution: 
- **Temporal** (when): Helps identify sequences and patterns in time of events
- **Relational** (who, what, where): Components of crime, their positions and interactions
- **Functional** (how): What was possible and impossible (e.g., check if a suspectâ€™s computer as capable of downloading and displaying the graph files presented as incriminating evidence)

It is important to draw a **case timeline**.
