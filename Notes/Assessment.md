The assessment define the **scope** and likely the **venue** of the examination. 
## The goal of the assessment

During this step we want to identify:
1. The stakeholders
2. The sources of evidence: the sources of data must be **reliable**. it can be interesting to follow the data path. This depends on the kind of case or crime category.
3. The forensic tools required: the [[Digital evidence]] must be collected using [[Forensics tools]] and those tools must be court-recognised **dependable tools**.
4. The personnel needed: the personnel must be **qualified** to do their jobs.
5. Collect all needed legal documentation: get any permissions for resources not covered by warrants.

The goal of this step is to to answer questions such as:
- What's the scope ?
- What we want to find ?
- Which tools are we going to use ?

Sometimes we need help from someone (ex: during a [[Ransomware attack]] we can get help from the sysadmin.)

## Different authorisation level

- **Internal investigations**: need of a signed letter of agreement outlining the scope of the investigation along with contractual details. There is no court involved.
- **Civil investigations**: need of a court order prior to starting
- **Criminal investigations**: need of a court order prior to starting
