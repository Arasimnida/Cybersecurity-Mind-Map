It is not just because someone said something that he is guilty. For example, if we found an email where someone sent "I killed him !" doesn't mean that he really killed someone. In that case the [[Digital evidence]] is not enough, a confession and other evidence were needed.

This requires asking a number of questions which include:
- Is the material an opinion (hearsay)?
- Is the evidence sustained by the testimony of an expert witness?

Knowledge from secondary sources is *hearsay evidence* and is, **in principle**, inadmissible.
