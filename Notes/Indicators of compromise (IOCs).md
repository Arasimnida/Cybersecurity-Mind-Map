IOCs serve **as forensic evidence of potential intrusions** on a host system or [[Network]]. These artefacts enable us to detect intrusion attempts or other malicious activities.

Examples:
- Unusual traffic going in and out of the network
- Unknown files, applications and processes in the system
- Suspicious activity in administrator or privileged accounts
