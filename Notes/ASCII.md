**ASCII** is the common code text representation for character encoding.
## ASCII Extensions

ASCII alone could not encode common character in European languages. Extensions kept ASCII character set and ***used the unused portion of the address space and control codes*** for additional characters.

## Popular ASCII Extensions

**Windows 1252** (also called CP1252) and **[[ISO-8859]]** were the most widely used encoding schemes until 2008 when [[UTF-8]] became the most common.
