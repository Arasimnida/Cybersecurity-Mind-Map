A **Virtual Address Space** is a mapping structure used to link the [[Physical Memory Address]] to a *[[Virtual Memory Address]]*.

A **virtual linear address space** is organised into units named [[Pages]]. When a [[Programs]] in a running process attempts to access a **linear address** the mapping uses memory-resident [[Page Directories]] and **[[Page Tables]]** to translate the linear address (virtual) into a physical address.
