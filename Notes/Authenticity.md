The question of authenticity is basically asking if the [[Digital evidence]] is what it purports to be. We want to be sure that the evidence was collected from the right place.

This requires asking a number of questions which include:
- Was it collected correctly?
- Could it have been altered in any way?

Must show that:
- Evidence **was acquired from** a specific computer and / or location
- A **complete and accurate copy** of digital evidence was acquired
- Evidence remained **unchanged since it was collected**

A crucial aspect of authentication is maintaining and documenting the [[Chain of custody]] of [[Digital evidence]].
