ISO-8859 extends 7 bit [[ASCII]] to 8 bit and is **used to encode most European Languages**

- ISO-8859-1 (aka Latin-1) is very used as it can encode most of the common European languages
- In 1999, ISO needed to make the Euro currency symbol available (a few other characters were also desired). So ISO created ISO-8859-15, which is **identical to ISO-8859-1 except for 8 chars** 

ISO-8859-1 is akin to Windows-1252 except for the code points 128-159 (0x80-0x9F)
