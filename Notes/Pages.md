**Pages** are units to organised [[Virtual Address Space]]. The ***[[Operating Systems]] maps pages*** into *[[Physical Memory (RAM)]]* in an arbitrary order and maintains an **independent** [[Virtual Address Space]] (and physical mapping) for each [[Processes]].

Those pages are organised using:
- [[Page Directories]]
- [[Page Tables]]

The typical page is 4 KB on [[x86 platforms]] (the [[IA-32 Architecture]] also supports pages of size 4 MB).
