A digital fingerprint is produced by a **message digest algorithm** ([[Hash function]]), e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-3.

“Fingerprint” emphasises the near **uniqueness of a message digest** calculated using a digest algorithm. Therefore, to **authenticate** that the copy is identical to the original (i.e., hash values). **Make a 2nd copy**.
