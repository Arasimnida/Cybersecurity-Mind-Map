The question of relevance is usually the first considered by a judge: If it is not relevant, then the [[Digital evidence]] is inadmissible.

To be deemed relevant, evidence must satisfy 2 conditions:
1. It must be **material** – directly relating to the case being presented
2. It must be **probative** – proves something that will help get to the truth of the situation

If some other stuff is found we have to call the police to have a new warrant.
