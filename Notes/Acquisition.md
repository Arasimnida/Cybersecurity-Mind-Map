During the acquisition phase, we collect evidences, we always have a track of everything from the beginning which is called: [[Chain of custody]]. The chain is **really important** for the acquisition phase. If there is a gap in this chain, then it can not be consider as [[Admissibility]].

Evidence collection must follow the [[Digital Evidence Collection Methodology]]. Evidence collection methods must assure that:
- All issues of **legal** "search & seizure" are followed in order to respect the [[Legality]].
- Evidence **integrity** was preserved upon extraction for [[Authenticity]].
- Evidence presented to the court is **authentic**.
- Evidence collection is as **complete** as possible.

It is important to generate **integrity checks**. It aim to show that evidence has not been altered from the time it was collected, thus supporting the authentication process. In order to perform those checks we can use [[Digital fingerprint]].
