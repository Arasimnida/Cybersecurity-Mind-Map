Digital evidence is extensively monitored and used by national and international law enforcement agencies (ex: FBI, INTERPOL, NSA...). It is any probative information stored or transmitted in **digital form** that a party to a court case may use at trial.

Any data stored or transmitted using a computer that support or refute a theory of how an offence occurred or that such intent or alibi can be considered as a digital evidence. The electronic environment where digital evidence can potentially exist is called a *digital crime scene*

Examples of digital evidences :
- Emails
- Digital photos
- ATM transaction logs
- [[Database]]
- Backups
- Network traces
- Social network activity
