Techniques to crack a password or break the [[Encryption]] of a file. Those techniques are automated by password cracking software. A password cracker works by trial and error.
## Brute force attacks
We try every possible key / password until succeeds.
## Dictionary attacks or Rainbow table attack
Reduce the number of trials required and will usually be attempted before brute force. A **rainbow table attack** is a type of dictionary attack that uses [[Rainbow Table]]. If we have access to the hashed password and the [[Password]] hash and there is no [[Salt]], you can compare it with value in table.
