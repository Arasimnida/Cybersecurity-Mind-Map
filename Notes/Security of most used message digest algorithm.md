Brute force attacks find collisions in 2m/2tries, where m is the number of bits
- MD5 (128 bits) **Very weak** Collisions found in 2^39 tries << 2^64
- SHA-1 (*Secure Hash Algorithm*, 160 bits) **Weak** Collisions found in 2^63 tries << 2^80
- SHA-2 (256 to 512 bits) **Ok** Collisions found in 2128 or 2256 tries (secure, for now)
- SHA-3 (256 to 512 bits) **Ok**
