The chain of custody is here to assure the **continuity of possession**. The goal of the chain is to make [[Digital evidence]] respect the [[Admissibility]].

 It begins when evidentiary materials are first seized:
 - Time and date taken
 - From whom and where
 - Complete description of each item

**Every time an item changes hands**, time, date and people involved (need to get signatures)

## Potential problems with the chain of custody
1. Incomplete: gaps (**no gaps allowed in history!**)
2. Inconsistent dates
3. lacking custodians' signatures or identification
4. Custodian is not competent or authorised
