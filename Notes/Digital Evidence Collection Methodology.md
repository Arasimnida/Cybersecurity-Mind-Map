When [[Digital evidence]] are collected we have to follow general principles:
- Collect the data artefacts without modifying them.
- Other than in exceptional situations, **never work on original** data sources: **create a copy** of the original data.
- **Store** the original and the 2nd copy (or other collected evidence) in a secure location of restricted access.
- In a *“live acquisition”*, use proper procedures to capture data on-site: live forensics vs. post mortem analysis.
- **Document** **all** **steps** taken to collect the devices from the initial contact through arrival at the forensic lab.
