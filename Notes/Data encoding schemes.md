## The need for data encoding schemes

When storing and transmitting data the following basic data
types must be represented in raw [[Bytes]]:
- Characters: ‘A’, ‘1’, ‘#’, ‘á’
- [[Integers]] signed and unsigned: long (32 bits) and short (16 bits)
- Floating point single and double
- [[Boolean]]

Hence, to store text as [[Binary]] data, one must specify an
encoding for that text.
## Examples of encoding schemes

- [[ASCII]]
- [[ASCII]] Extensions
- [[Unicode encoding]]
- [[Base64]]
