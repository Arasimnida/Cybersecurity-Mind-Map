The work product of your analysis is the **documentation**.
- Without good documentation, you canâ€™t present a robust case
- Must be such that it allows for the reproducibility of findings

## 5 levels of documentation
1. **General case documentation:** Contact information for everyone involved, all legal authorisations. First response documentation: notes, photographs, videos, etc.
2. **Procedural documentation:** Every task that was performed related to the investigation, list of equipment seized, steps taken and tools used, detailed data analysis.
3. **Process documentation:** User manuals, installation manuals, update history logs, results of testing, README logs
4. **Case timeline:** Systematic analysis of what transpired, times and dates of related events
5. [[Chain of custody]]
