The **steganography** is the art and science of communicating in a way that hides the existence of a message. Steganography simply takes one piece of information (*secret*) and hides it within another (*carrier / cover*).

Digital steganography works by encoding secret bits in files, such as photos or audio files with secret data.

There are different [[Steganography techniques]], the most famous one is the [[Least Significant Bit (LSB)]].
## Desired properties of steganography

1. **Imperceptibility:** The resultant stego image appears innocuous enough, and not having severe visual artefacts
2. **Capacity:** The hiding capacity should be as high as possible
3. **Security:** Must be able to resist active as well as passive attacks

## Challenges of steganography

There is 2 types of adversary:
1. **Passive adversary**: does it contain a secret ? What is that secret ?
2. **Active adversary**: don't know if there is a secret, but i'll destroy it
